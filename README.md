# Hi, I am Valentin CATHERINE 

## 4-th year Engineering Master's student in France at the Ecole Centrale de Lille  

- I am seeking an 5-month internship (from September to February ideally) in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
- Normally, I would have been by the end of July in São Paulo (Brazil) to make a double degree. Unfortunately, for personal and health reasons, I postponed my departure for the next semester, scheduled for early March 2022. 
- For 2 years, I realized various projets linked with Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning

## My projects

### Project 1 : Exploratory Data Analysis and Prediction of the load factor of French wind farms in Python

#### ***Context***

This project was included in our education path in Centrale Lille in a team of 12 students.It was a 18-month project in conjunction with EDF (Énergie De France) and consisted in improving the forecast of consumption and non-controllable electricity production. 
Due to economic and legislative reasons, EDF has to balance its production with its customers' consumption while ensuring maximum production of renewable energies. The gaps are filled on the European electricity market (risk of loss-making sales/negative prices). 

#### ***Our objectives***

The project was mainly exploratory in the sense that even the client gave us a free hand in the search, extraction and analysis. Concretely, we had to benchmark the weather-related connected object data available on the net. Then, the goal was to collect and analyse a sample of this data. Thus, 3 teams were formed: research, extraction and analysis. Finally, if the analysis provided was relevant, our client suggested that we look into predicting the load factor of the wind farm.  Thus, in the last two months, the Machine Learning division was created. 

#### ***My achievements***

I was part of two teams: Analysis and then, at the end of the project, Machine Learning where I was appointed leader in both. My main task was to assist our project leader in developing algorithms in Python to analyse the stations extracted by the Extraction division. Finally, I mainly led the development and implementation of artificial intelligence algorithms to predict the load factor of the French wind farm.  The client was very satisfied with the work done and underlined his satisfaction in the prediction results of the Machine Learning team.
